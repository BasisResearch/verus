Three ways of writing a transition system in Verus, each exported to TLA+ by
`verus -V tla-export=<module> --log-dir <dir> <file>` (the flag is the Basis
fork's; see `vir/src/tla.rs`). The export is written under the log directory
as `<State>_tla.tla`, named after the module it declares so TLC can load it,
beside a `<State>_tla.cfg` skeleton and a `<State>_tla.tla.json` report of
what was recognised, refused and left unbounded.

- `counter.rs`, hand-rolled: `init(s)`, `next(pre, post)` as an `exists` over
  a step enum, one relational spec fn per step, invariants as `(State) ->
  bool` spec fns. Module `counter`. `Counter.tla`/`Counter.cfg` are the same
  system written by hand. Checked with `tlc2.TLC -deadlock -continue`, both
  give 28 states generated, 18 distinct, and the same six violations of
  `bounded` (`x` reaches 4); `sum_small` holds.
- `adder_sync.rs`, VerusSync: `state_machine!`. Module `adder_sync::Adder`.
  The step's `int` parameter is a hole: the `.cfg` lists `Dom_Step_add_v0`
  commented out, and TLC stops until it is given a finite set (and the model
  a `CONSTRAINT`, since `x` is unbounded).
- `toggle_sync.rs`, VerusSync with transitions that take no parameters. Module
  `toggle_sync::Toggle`. The macro generates `flip_enabled(pre)` and
  `reset_enabled(pre)`, which have an invariant's signature; the invariants
  are the conjuncts of the generated `State::invariant`, so only `n_nonneg`
  is checked, and the report lists the others as excluded candidates.
- `mutex_tla.rs`, verus-tla: `init()`/`next()` return closures and actions are
  `Action { precondition, transition }` records built by spec fns, reduced
  symbolically. Module `mutex_tla`. The export has no hole and no refusal and
  checks under TLC as written: 10 distinct states, both invariants hold.

The invariants are, by default, the `#[invariant]` methods for VerusSync,
every closure `() -> spec_fn(State) -> bool` for verus-tla, and every
`(State) -> bool` spec fn in the module for a hand-rolled model, except one
that `init`/`next` read unprimed (a guard, not an invariant). The report's
`candidates` lists every candidate with whether it was included and why.
`-V tla-export=<module>:inv1,inv2` checks exactly the named ones instead.

Whatever the export cannot express is printed as `Assert(FALSE, "...")`, so
TLC stops with the reason wherever it is evaluated. An invariant that reaches
one is left out of the `.cfg` and listed in the report's
`skipped_invariants`.

`rust_verify_test/tests/tla_export.rs` exports the four fixtures (as crate
`test_crate`, so the modules are `test_crate`, `test_crate::Adder`,
`test_crate::Toggle` and `test_crate`) and checks the reports. With `TLA2TOOLS_JAR` naming a
`tla2tools.jar` it also parses every export with SANY and model-checks the
counter against `Counter.tla`:
